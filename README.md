# ScibPlot
**Codes for:**
- Processing the output of benchmarking of single-cell sequencing integration methods (SCIB).
- Producing nice plot.

**Four main functions includes:**
- `scib_calculate_scores` calulates batch correction, bio conservation and overscore following the weighting algorithm proposed by SCIB.
  - The input data should have row names as methods and column names as parameters for SCIB calculations.
- `scib_score2tab` produces and checks necessary parameters for plotting. 
  - You need to manually add some necessary information to the `scib_calculate_scores` output file: 
  - **Methods:** usually the row name of the SCIB result, like "scVI" and "Harmony".
  - **Features:** "HVG" or "FULL", which depends on the corresponding integration method and calculation process.
  - **Scaling:** "scaled" or "unscaled", which depends on the content of the matrix needed for the integration algorithm. For example, scVI requires the input of the raw counts matrix (labeled "unscaled").
  - **Output:** one of "Embedding", "Graph" and "Features", which depends on who the integration method works for.
- `scib_tab2plot` organizes and generates all the elements needed for the drawing based on the objects generated by `scib_score2tab`.
- `scib_NicePlot` produces the final image based on the objects generated by `scib_tab2plot`.

**Other functions for internal data processing:**
- `add_column_if_missing`
- `check_column_value`
